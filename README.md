# Raster_Functions

This repository houses modern image processing and analytic tools called raster functions. Raster functions are lightweight and process only the pixels visible on your screen, in memory, without creating intermediate files. They are powerful because you can chain them together and apply them on huge rasters and mosaics on the fly.

In this repository, you will find useful function chains (*.rft.xml) created by the Esri community. You can also create custom raster functions in Python that work seamlessly with the several dozen functions that ship with ArcGIS.

It is similar to the [repo](https://github.com/Esri/raster-functions) provided by [Esri](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home)
